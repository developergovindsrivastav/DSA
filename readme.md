## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of well-documented data structures and algorithms. The main goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and understanding the fundamental concepts of DSA.

## Data Structures

The repository covers a wide range of data structures, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

Each data structure is explained in detail, along with its implementation in various programming languages.

## Algorithms

The repository also includes various algorithms, such as:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming algorithms
- And many more!

Each algorithm is explained with its time and space complexity analysis, along with code examples in different programming languages.

## Contributing
